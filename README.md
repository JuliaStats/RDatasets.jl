The RDatasets package provides an easy way for Julia users to experiment with most of the standard data sets that are available in the core of R as well as datasets included with many of R's most popular packages. This package is essentially a simplistic port of the Rdatasets repo created by Vincent Arelbundock, who conveniently gathered data sets from many of the standard R packages in one convenient location on GitHub at https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets

In order to load one of the data sets included in the RDatasets package, you will need to have the `DataFrames` package installed. This package is automatically installed as a dependency of the `RDatasets` package if you install `RDatasets` as follows:

    Pkg.add("RDatasets")

After installing the RDatasets package, you can then load data sets using the `dataset()` function, which takes the name of a package and a data set as arguments:

    using RDatasets
    iris = dataset("datasets", "iris")
    neuro = dataset("boot", "neuro")
