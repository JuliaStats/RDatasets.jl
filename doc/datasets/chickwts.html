<h2>Chicken Weights by Feed Type</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness
of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>chickwts</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>


<p>A data frame with 71 observations on 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>weight</dt><dd><p>a numeric variable giving the chick weight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>feed</dt><dd><p>a factor giving the feed type.</p>
</dd>
