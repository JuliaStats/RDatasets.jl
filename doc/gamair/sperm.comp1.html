<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sperm counts reported are total counts in ejaculate from a single
copulation, for each of 15 couples. Also recorded are the time since the
couple's previous copulation, and the proportion of that time that the couple
had spent together. The data are from volunteers from Manchester University
and were gathered to test theories about human sperm competition.
