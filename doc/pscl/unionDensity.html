<h2>cross national rates of trade union density</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and
predictors, in 20 countries.  Two of the predictors are highly
collinear, and are the source of a debate between Stephens and
Wallerstein (1991), later reviewed by Western and Jackman (1994).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(unionDensity)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>



<ul>
<li><p><code>union</code>numeric, percentage of the total number of wage
and salary earners plus the unemployed who are union members,
measured between 1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn from 1979
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>left</code>numeric, an index tapping the extent to which
parties of the left have controlled governments since 1919, due to
Wilensky (1981).
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>size</code>numeric, log of labor force size, defined as the
number of wage and salary earners, plus the unemployed
</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>concen</code>numeric, percentage of employment, shipments, or
production accounted for by the four largest enterprises in a
particular industry, averaged over industries (with weights
proportional to the size of the industry) and the resulting measure
is normalized such that the United States scores a 1.0, and is due
to Pryor (1973). Some of the scores on this variable are imputed
using procedures described in Stephens and Wallerstein (1991, 945).
