<h2>Effect of technical grade and commercially formulated auxin herbicides</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>MCPA, 2,4-D, mecorprop and dichorlprop were applied either as technical grades
materials  (h = 1, 2, 3, 4) or as commercial formulations (herb = 5, 6, 7, 8). 
Each experimental unit consisted of five 1-week old seedlings grown together
in a pot of nutrient solution during 14 days. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(auxins)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 150 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>r</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>h</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>y</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dose</code></dt><dd><p>a numeric vector</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data are parts of a larger joint action experiment with various herbicides.
</p>
<p>The eight herbicide preparations are naturally grouped into four pairs:
(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), and (4, 8), and in each pair of herbicides
should have the same active ingredients but different formulation
constituents, which were assumed to be biologically inert. The data consist
of the 150 observations y of dry weights, each observation being the weight
of five plants grown in the same pot. All the eight herbicide preparations have
essentially the same mode of action in the plant; they all act like the plant 
auxins, which are plant regulators that affect cell enlongation an other 
essential metabolic pathways. One of the objects of the experiment was to test
if the response functions were identical except for a multiplicative factor in 
the dose. This is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for a similar
mode of action for the herbicides.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

## Fitting model with varying lower limits
auxins.m1 &lt;- boxcox(drm(y ~ dose, h, 
pmodels = data.frame(h, h, 1, h), fct = LL.4(), data = auxins), method = "anova")

## Fitting model with common lower limit
auxins.m2 &lt;- boxcox(drm(y ~ dose, h, 
pmodels = data.frame(h, 1, 1, h), fct = LL.4(), data = auxins), method = "anova")

## Comparing the two models
anova(auxins.m2, auxins.m1)
