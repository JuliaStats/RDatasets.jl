Dose-response profile of degradation of agrochemical using lepidium
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimation of the degradation profile of an agrochemical based on soil
samples at depth 0-10cm from a calibration experiment.

Usage
~~~~~

::

   data(lepidium)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 42 observations on the following 2 variables.

``conc``
   a numeric vector of concentrations (g/ha)

``weight``
   a numeric vector of plant weight (g) after 3 weeks' growth

Details
~~~~~~~

It is an experiment with seven concentrations and six replicates per
concentration. *Lepidium* is rather robust as it only responds to high
concentrations.

Examples

::


   lepidium.m1 <- drm(weight~conc, data=lepidium, fct = LL.4())

   modelFit(lepidium.m1)

   plot(lepidium.m1, type = "all", log = "")
