Performance of decontaminants used in the culturing of a micro-organism
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The two decontaminants 1-hexadecylpyridium chloride and oxalic acid were
used. Additionally there was a control group (coded as concentration 0
and only included under oxalic acid).

Usage
~~~~~

::

   data("decontaminants")

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 128 observations on the following 3 variables.

``conc``
   a numeric vector of percentage weight per volume

``count``
   a numeric vector of numbers of M. bovis colonies at stationarity

``group``
   a factor with levels ``hpc`` and ``oxalic`` of the decontaminants
   used

Details
~~~~~~~

These data examplify Wadley's problem: counts where the maximum number
is not known. The data were analyzed by Trajstman (1989) using a
three-parameter logistic model and then re-analyzed by Morgan and Smith
(1992) using a three-parameter Weibull type II model. In both cases the
authors adjusted for overdispersion (in different ways).

It seems that Morgan and Smith (1992) fitted separate models for the two
decontaminants and using the control group for both model fits. In the
example below a joint model is fitted where the control group is used
once to determine a shared upper limit at concentration 0.
