<h2> Student Risk Taking </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Students were administered two parallel forms of a test after a random
assignment to three different treatments.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data("students")</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 35 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>treatment</code></dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>AA</code>, <code>C</code>, and
<code>NC</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>low</code></dt><dd><p>the result of the first test.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>high</code></dt><dd><p>the result of the second test.</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data arise from a large study of risk taking (Timm, 2002).
Students were randomly assigned to three different
treatments labelled AA, C and NC. Students were administered two   
parallel forms of a test called <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>. The aim is to 
carry out a test of the equality of the bivariate means of each treatment
population.
