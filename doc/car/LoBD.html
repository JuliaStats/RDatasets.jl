Cancer drug data use to provide an example of the use of the skew power distributions.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A portion of an experiment to determine the limit of blank/limit of detection in a biochemical assay.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>LoBD</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 84 observations on the following 9 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>pool</code></dt><dd><p>a factor with levels <code>1</code> <code>2</code> <code>3</code> <code>4</code> 
<code>5</code> <code>6</code> <code>7</code> <code>8</code> <code>9</code> <code>10</code> <code>11</code> <code>12</code> 
denoting the 12 pools used in the experiment; 
each pool had a different level of drug.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Important characteristics of a clinical chemistry assay are its 
limit of blank (LoB), and its limit of detection (LoD).  
The LoB, conceptually the highest reading likely to be obtained from
a zero-concentration sample, is defined operationally by the upper 95% 
point of readings obtained from samples that do not contain the analyte.
The LoD, conceptually the lowest level of analyte that can be reliably 
determined not to be blank, is defined operationally as true value at 
which there is a 95% chance of the reading being above the LoB. 
</p>
<p>These data are from a portion of a  LoB/D study 
of an assay for a drug used to treat certain cancers.  
Twelve pools were used, four of them blanks of different types,
and eight with successively increasing drug levels.  The 8 columns
of the data set refer to measurements made using different instruments I
and reagent lots L.
