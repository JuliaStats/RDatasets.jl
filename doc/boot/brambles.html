Spatial Location of Bramble Canes
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>The <code>brambles</code> data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns.
</p>
<p>The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was recorded.  
We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot can be thought of
as a unit square. The bramble canes were also classified by their age.
</p>
