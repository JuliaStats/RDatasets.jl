<h2>
Darwin's Plant Height Differences
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>The <code>darwin</code> data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.
</p>
<p>Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of
cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants.  15 pairs of plants
were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one
self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the
same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and
the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are
recorded in eighths of an inch.
