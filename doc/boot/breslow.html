<h2>
Smoking Deaths Among Doctors
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>breslow</code> data frame has 10 rows and 5 columns.
</p>
<p>In 1961 Doll and Hill sent out a questionnaire to all men on the British 
Medical Register enquiring about their smoking habits. Almost 70% of 
such men replied.  Death certificates were obtained for medical practitioners
and causes of death were assigned on the basis of these certificates.  The
<code>breslow</code> data set contains the person-years of observations and deaths from
coronary artery disease accumulated during the first ten years of the study.
