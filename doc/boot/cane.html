<h2>
Sugar-cane Disease Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>The <code>cane</code> data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. 
The data frame represents a randomized
block design with 45 varieties of sugar-cane and 4 blocks.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
cane
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>


<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>n</code></dt><dd>
<p>The total number of shoots in each plot.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt><dd>
<p>The number of diseased shoots.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x</code></dt><dd>
<p>The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each plot.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>var</code></dt><dd>
<p>A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>block</code></dt><dd>
<p>A factor for the blocks.
</p>
</dd></dl>



<h3>Details</h3>


<p>The aim of the experiment was to classify the varieties into
resistant, intermediate and susceptible to a disease called &quot;coal of
sugar-cane&quot; (carvao da cana-de-acucar).  This is a disease that is
common in sugar-cane plantations in certain areas of Brazil.
</p>
<p>For each plot, fifty pieces of sugar-cane stem were put in a solution
containing the disease agent and then some were planted in the plot.
After a fixed period of time, the total number of shoots and the number
of diseased shoots were recorded.
