<h2>
Calcium Uptake Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>The <code>calcium</code> data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.
</p>
<p>Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University,
conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage
and transport of calcium across plasma membrane.  Cells were
suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and
then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was
measured.  The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different
times of suspension each replicated 3 times.

<h3>Format</h3>


<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
