<h2>25 Personality items representing 5 factors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>25 personality self report items taken from the International Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org) were included as part of the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA) web based personality assessment project.  The data from 2800 subjects are included here as a demonstration set for scale construction, factor analysis, and Item Response Theory analysis.  Three additional demographic variables (sex, education, and age) are also included.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The first 25 items are organized by five putative factors: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Opennness.  The scoring key is created using  <code>make.keys</code>, the scores are found using  <code>score.items</code>.
</p>
<p>These five factors are a useful example of using <code>irt.fa</code> to do Item Response Theory based latent factor analysis of the <code>polychoric</code> correlation matrix.  The endorsement plots for each item, as well as the item information functions reveal that the items differ in their quality.
</p>
<p>The item data were collected using a 6 point response scale: 
1 Very Inaccurate
2 Moderately Inaccurate
3 Slightly Inaccurate
4 Slightly Accurate
5 Moderately Accurate
6 Very Accurate
</p>
<p>as part of the Synthetic Apeture Personality Assessment (SAPA <a href="http://sapa-project.org">http://sapa-project.org</a>) project.  To see an example of the data collection technique, visit <a href="http://SAPA-project.org">http://SAPA-project.org</a>.  The items given were sampled from the International Personality Item Pool of Lewis Goldberg using the sampling technique of SAPA.  This is a sample data set taken from the much larger SAPA data bank.
